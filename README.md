# Classic Brutalist

### Addon for World of Warcraft Classic

### Summary
This add-on exemplifies efficiency and simplicity, adopting a brutalist approach to enhance the gaming experience. Tailored primarily to my personal preferences, it may not suit everyone; however, I welcome everyone to try it and provide feedback. Its main goal is to consolidate several complex add-ons into a single, streamlined option. The user interface is redesigned into a minimalistic yet practical style, faithfully maintaining the game's original art style by utilizing existing game elements. It introduces key quality-of-life features with minimal processing demand, concentrating on essential functionalities without superfluous details.
