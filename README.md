# Classic+ Pro Beta 1.0

## Addon for World of Warcraft Classic

### Overview
- A resource-efficient add-on that uses only 380kb of memory to customize and enhance the native user interface and user experience.
- The general intention for this addon was to avoid having to download a whole catalog of addons, which are often bloated with code and sometimes inefficient due to their modifiability and outdated architecture.
- Primarily download this addon as well as Questie and Auctionator, and you are ready to play.
- Gives the overall user interface a more minimalistic, streamlined look and feel, while maintaining the integrity of the game's overall art direction by using only native game textures and components.
- Adds simple but effective quality of life features with minimal processing requirements.

#### Font Change
- Moving the "fonts" folder to the "classic_" directory changes the overall in-game font.

- Default action bars are now centered at the bottom of the screen. 
- Range check coloring lets you know when you are in range to use a particular action by recoloring the action button.

- You will see the container slots only when the main bag is open.

- Sort Button added. This only affects the additional bags, not the main bag.
